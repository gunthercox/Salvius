/**
 * For Internal Use Only.
 * This is the global (static) object that implements the Xuggler IO library.
 * <p>
 * The following methods are not meant to be generally
 * called by code (although they can be).
 * </p></p>
 * You should never need to call this method.  Calling {@link URLProtocolManager#registerFactory(String, IURLProtocolHandlerFactory)}
 * should cause it to be instantiated.
 *</p></p>
 * They are generally 'thread-aware' but not 'thread-safe', meaning if you use a handle
 * on a thread, you are a responsible for making sure you don't
 * reuse it on other threads.
 * </p></p>
 * They forward into ffmpeg's URL read/write/seek capabilities
 * and allow our test scripts to make sure our URLProtocolHandlers
 * (and FFMPEG's native handlers) work as expected.
 * </p></p>
 * Lastly this class, unlike other classes in the library, does not use SWIG to generate
 * the Java objects, so you need to be careful not to change method names as the corresponding
 * native code relies on specific naming and parameters.
