 * This class is held on to by the {@link RefCounted} classes and nulled when
 * that object is collected. It has no references to any (non static) members
 * and so its {@link #finalize()} method will not hold up the collection of any
 * other object.
 * <p>
 * It exists so that we still have a mechanism that always frees native memory;
 * in most cases the {@link JNIReference} will enqueue correctly with the
 * {@link JNIMemoryManager}, and then the next call to a Ferry based method will
 * drain that queue, but sometimes there is no extra call to one of those
 * methods; in this case we'll drain the queue when this gets finalized.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It does a {@link JNIMemoryManager#gc()} which might race with the
 * {@link JNIMemoryManager#gc()} that a {@link JNIReference} does on allocation
 * of a new object but that's a safe race.
