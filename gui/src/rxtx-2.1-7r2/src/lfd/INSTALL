1. BUILDING LFD

  In the src/lfd directory edit lockdaemon.c and specify the following defines:

#define LOCK fhs_lock
#define UNLOCK fhs_unlock
#define LOCKDIR "/var/lock"

   LOCK may be fhs_lock (linux) or uucp_lock (Solaris)
   UNLOCK may be fhs_unlock (Linux) or fhs_unlock (Solaris)
   LOCkDIR may be /var/lock (Linux) or /var/spool/lock (Solaris)

   After setting up the defines type make to build lfd.

2. INSTALLING.

   daemons are usually placed in the /usr/sbin directory.
   in.lfd will need to be setup for inetd or xinetd support.

2.1 xinetd support on RedHat Linux:

   edit /etc/services and add the following lines:

lockfiled	50001/tcp			# lock file daemon
lockfiled	50001/ucp			# lock file daemon


   create a file /etc/xinetd.d/lfd with the folowing contents:

# default: on
# description: The lockfiled server serves lockfiles; it uses \
#	
service lfd
{
	flags		= REUSE
	socket_type	= stream        
	wait		= no
	user		= uucp
	server		= /usr/sbin/in.lfd
	log_on_failure	+= USERID
	disable		= no
}

2.2 inetd support on Solaris:

   edit /etc/services and add the following lines:

lfd       50001/tcp                       # lock file daemon
lfd       50001/ucp                       # lock file daemon

   add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf

lockfiled   stream tcp nowait  uucp  /usr/sbin/in.lfd lfd
