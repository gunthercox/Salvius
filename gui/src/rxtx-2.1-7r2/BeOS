BeOS serial support is in the early stages.  configure and the resulting 
Makefile should work properly.  Initial readbyte/writebyte type support is 
included.

Test.java in contrib/ works on BeOS.

rxtx.proj in contrib/ is included for people using the IDE that BeOS uses.


Initially we tried to use the standard POSIX functions to get BeOS working.  It
became obvious the BeOS kernel API (See Serial.h on BeOS) would have to be 
used to get Events working.  With simple build and read/write functionality 
we are releasing the work in case anyone wants to help contribute to the
project.

src/SerialImp.cpp is the BeOS support.
