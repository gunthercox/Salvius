/**
    An advanced API for reading, decoding, re-sampling, encoding and writing
    of most media files.
    <p>
    Xuggler is a library that wraps the
    <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a> C library with a slightly simpler interface designed
    to be used safely from within Java (and eventually any garbage-collected.
    language).
    </p><p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    The library's goals are:
    <ul>
    <li>Ease of Use: Provide the power of
    <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a> with an easier learning curve for Java developers.</li>
    <li>Safety: Run natively inside a Java Virtual
    Machine process, and minimize the odds of incorrect coding
    of native <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a> code causing crashes</li>
    <li>Portability: Write portable code that should run most places
    where <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a> can run</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    And so we set out to do that with this package.
    As a result you'll find the following major features:

    <h2>Creating Xuggler Objects</h2>
    In general very few Xuggler Interfaces provide pure Java constructors (i.e. you can't create one using the
    Java "new" operator).  Instead, they will provide a "make" method
    that you can use  For example: {@link com.xuggle.xuggler.IContainer#make()}
    <h2>How To Learn More</h2>
    There's a lot to this library, and we hope to add more tutorials.  But if you're itching to get
    started, see the source code for {@link com.xuggle.xuggler.Converter} for an example program that reads
    files in one media format and converts to a new format, and the source code for
    {@link com.xuggle.xuggler.io.FileProtocolHandler} for an example of an example Java object
    that allows Xuggler (and FFMPEG) to read data to and from
    arbitrary data sources.

    Or, check out the contents of the <code>com.xuggle.xuggler.demos</code> package
    for some cool demos that show the Xuggler in action.
    </p>
    Or, if you have other questions, check out <a href="http://www.xuggle.com/">Xuggle</a>.  We'd love to hear from you.
    <h2>What if Xuggler Crashes the Virtual Machine?</h2>
    We try really hard to make it hard for you to crash the
    Java virtual machine using Xuggler, but it can happen.
    <p>
    If for some reason you are able to crash the JVM,
    we want to hear about it (even if it's your error).
    Send us mail: bugs (at) xuggler.com
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, when we have time to work on open source projects,
      fixing bugs that crash the JVM will take priority.
    </p>
    <h2>Java Memory Management</h2>
    Even though you are actually accessing native objects from Java
    code, you can use these objects just like you would Java objects.
    The garbage collector will clean up for you.
    <p>
    That said, we do advise you to use close() methods if provided
    (for example {@link com.xuggle.xuggler.IContainer#close()}).  These
     methods can free up resources (like file handles) for other
     parts of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
    In general, treat Xuggler objects like you would Hibernate
    data-base connections... use them, but close them when
    you don't need them.
    </p>
    <h2>Java Memory Management For Those Who Can't Mind Their Own Business</h2>
    This section is for people who can't just take our word for something, and instead start to poke around
    and notice that everything derives from {@link com.xuggle.ferry.RefCounted}.
    <p>For those people, let's just say that you should effectively ignore that, and just use the objects like
    you would any other Java object.
    </p>
    <p>
    Really.  We mean that.
