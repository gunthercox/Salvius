/**
 * 
 * Internal Only.
 * 
 * An Opaque handle that holds a Native mPointer/handle.
 * 
 * This class holds a opaque long value that can be used to pass into JNI C
 * function that expect a ** in C.
 * <p>
 * For example, a function like this in native code:
 * </p>
 * <code>
 * <pre>
 *   int url_open(URLContext **handlePtr, char *name, int flags);
 *   int url_read(URLContext *handle, void* buf, int len);
 * </pre>
 * </code> might map to the following Java method: <code>
 * <pre>
 * public class Example {
 *   public native int url_open(JNIPointerReference p, String name, int flags);
 *   public native int url_read(JNIPointerReference p, byte[] buf, int len);
 *   public void example() {
 *      int retval = 0;
 *      JNIPointerReference p;
 *      // p.setPointer is called by the native function 
 *      retval = url_open(p, "foo", 0);
 *      
 *      // p.getPointer is called by the native function
 *      byte[] buf = new bytes[1024];
 *      retval = url_read(p, buf, buf.length);
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT: DO NOT RENAME THIS CLASS OR METHODS IN IT. NATIVE CODE DEPENDS
 * ON THE NAMES AND SIGNATURES.</b>
 * </p>
