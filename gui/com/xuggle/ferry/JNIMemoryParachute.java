/**
 * Internal Only.  The JNIMemoryParachute is a very weird beast.  Don't look here.
 * <p>
 * Damn it... I told you not to.  So in normal cases Java handles out
 * of memory conditions by throwing an {@link OutOfMemoryError}.  However
 * when you add JNI to the mix, things get complicated.  In the ferry
 * system Java calls native code which in turns calls Java code.
 * <p>
 * In fact sometimes native code calls back into Java code to allocate
 * memory (using the {@link JNIMemoryAllocator}).  However a problem occurs
 * if the {@link JNIMemoryAllocator} runs out of heap memory -- it throws
 * an OutOfMemoryError back into the native code.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The native code is smart enough to see that, and to just return back to
 * it's calling Java code where the {@link OutOfMemoryError} should be
 * thrown again.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The problem is in the various JNI implementations -- they sometimes need
 * to allocate heap memory just to return from native code.  When they attempt
 * to do that to return, they run into the original {@link OutOfMemoryError},
 * and fail.  The error differs depending on JVM.  On Sun's Java JRE for
 * Windows it can result in Windows terminating the JVM.  On Linux it can
 * result in Java terminating itself with an uncatchable {@link OutOfMemoryError}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * So enter the {@link JNIMemoryParachute}.  The {@link JNIMemoryAllocator}
 * allocates an instance of a {@link JNIMemoryParachute} at startup.  The
 * {@link JNIMemoryParachute} just holds on to some heap memory (about 10k)
 * "just in case".  Then if the {@link JNIMemoryAllocator} fails to allocate,
 * it pulls the rip cord on the parachute, and forces a Garbage Collect, before
 * returning the JNI.  The hope is that 10K is enough heap space for the JNI
 * implementation to correctly return to the underlying Java layer and handle
 * the original {@link OutOfMemoryError}.
 * </p>
 * <p>Now this is really just a hail mary (at the expense of 10k of memory) -
 * you can still get failures if multiple threads are all trying to go through
 * the JNI layer at the same time, but this helps minimize the odds of that
 * long enough for you to catch an error.</p>
 * <p>See.  Told you to not read.</p>
