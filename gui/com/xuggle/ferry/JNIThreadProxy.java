/**
 * Proxy for {@link java.lang.Thread} that is called by Ferry native code.

 * This class is called from native code to tell if a thread
 * is interrupted.  It only exposes the methods that are called
 * from the native code, and adds logging to aid in debugging.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If allows a global handler to be set.  This can be useful for
 * catching threads that are started from native code as there is no other
 * way to detect those and interrupt them.  If set, <b>the global handler
 * will always be checked BEFORE the local thread</b> allowing users to 
 * always get a callback on each interrupt check if they want.

 * changing the JNIHelper.cpp code that refers to it.
