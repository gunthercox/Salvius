This authentication module is built on top of gopam.py which is included with
Gate One.

It was originally written by Alan Schmitz.

The only non-obvious aspect of this module is that the pam_realm setting is only
used when the user is asked to authenticate and when the user's information is
stored in the 'users' directory.  It isn't actually used in any part of the
authentication (PAM doesn't take a "realm" setting).
