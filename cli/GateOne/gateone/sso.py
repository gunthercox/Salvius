About The SSO Module
====================
sso.py is a Tornado Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication module that implements
GSSAPI authentication via python-kerberos (import kerberos).  If "Negotiate"
authentication (GSSAPI SSO) fails it will gracefully fall back to "Basic" auth
(authenticating a given username/password against your Kerberos realm).

For this module to work you must add 'sso_realm' and 'sso_service' to your
Tornado application's settings.  See the docstring of the KerberosAuthMixin for
how to do this.

This module should work with regular MIT Kerberos implementations as well as
Active Directory (Heimdal is untested but should work fine).  If you're
experiencing trouble it is recommended that you set debug=True in your
application settings.  This will enable printing of Kerberos exception messages.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If your browser asks you for a password (i.e. SSO failed) there's probably
something wrong with your Kerberos configuration on either the client or the
server (usually it's a problem with forward/reverse DNS resolution or an
incorrect or missing service principal in your keytab).

If you're using Active Directory, make sure that there's an HTTP
servicePrincipalName (SPN) matching the FQDN of the host running your Tornado
server.  For example:  HTTP/somehost.somedomain.com@CORP.MYCOMPANY.COM
You may also want a short hostname SPN: HTTP/somehost@CORP.MYCOMPANY.COM

Also make sure that the service principal is in upper case as most clients (
web browsers) will auto-capitalize the principal when verifying the server.

Here's some things to test in order to find problems with your Kerberos config:

Try these from both the client and the server (NOTE: Assuming both are Unix):
kinit -p <user@REALM> # To verify you can authenticate via Kerberos (at all)
nslookup <server FQDN> # To verify the IP address reverse maps properly (below)
nslookup <IP address that 'server FQDN' resolves to>
kvno HTTP/somehost.somedomain.com # To verify your service principal

Remember: Kerberos is heavily dependent on DNS to verify the server and client
are who they claim to be.

I find that it is useful to get GSSAPI authentication working with OpenSSH first
before I attempt to get a custom service principal working with other
applications.  This is because SSH uses the HOST/ prinicipal which is often
taken care of automatically via most Kerberos management tools (including AD).
If you can get SSO working with SSH you can get SSO working with anything else.

    Authenticates users via Kerberos-based Single Sign-On.  Requires that you
    define 'sso_realm' and 'sso_service' in your Tornado Application settings.
    For example::

        settings = dict(
            cookie_secret="iYR123qg4UUdsgf4CRung6BFUBhizAciid8oq1YfJR3gN",
            static_path=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "static"),

            login_url="/auth",
            debug=True,
            sso_realm="EXAMPLE.COM",
            sso_service="HTTP" # Should pretty much always be HTTP
        )

    NOTE: If you're using 'HTTP' as the service it must be in all caps or it
    might not work with some browsers/clients (which auto-capitalize all
    services).
