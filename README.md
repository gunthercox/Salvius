### Using Rapsberry Pi and Arduino

** Salvius is an open source humanoid robot. For additional details visit: [salviusrobot.blogspot.com](http://salviusrobot.blogspot.com) **

Install the robots web ui by cloning this git repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/gunthercox/Salvius.git

The robot is contolled by a single page web app which can be hosted on the robot's server or on your own computer.
Open index.html in a browser to start the app.

Code for each Arduino board is located in within the arduino directory.

## Barracuda Drive
I have been running Barracuda Drive on my Rapsberry Pi. Its a nice addition for
running some lightweight applications which make working on the robot alot easier.

## Web Shell (Barracuda Drive Application)
You may want to install this web shell for Barracuda drive to use SSH on the Pi.
This is usefull for debugging and if the web interface is not available.
