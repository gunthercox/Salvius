***

## Server Setup:
I don't always set up servers but when I do, I choose Ubuntu.
This project runs on a Tomcat Java Server which you can choose during the initial installation of Ubuntu Server edition. It is also helpful to install OpenSSH at the same time.

* The files in the gui directory go on the robot's server.
* The java file in the interaction directory gets compiled as a jar and runs on the robots computer.
* The Arduino sketch in the arduino directory gets uploaded to the Arduino board.

## Arduino Setup:
* Plug Ethernet shield into Arduino Uno.
* Plug Seeed Relay Shield into Ethernet Shield.
* Attach 9 volt power supply to GND and +9V plugs of Relay Shield.
* PIR positive(+) to arduino 5V, PIR negative(-) to arduino GND, PIR OUT to HUB2 D3.
* Connect Ethernet shield to wireless router with Ethernet cable.
