# Open Source Humanoid Robot

Salvius is an open source humanoid robot. For details about this project visit:

## Server Setup:
I don't always set up servers but when I do, I choose Ubuntu.
This project runs on a Tomcat Java Server which you can choose during the initial installation of Ubuntu Server edition. It is also helpful to install OpenSSH at the same time.

* The files in the gui directory go on the robot's server.
* The java file in the interaction directory gets compiled as a jar and runs on the robots computer.
* The Arduino sketch in the arduino directory gets uploaded to the Arduino board.

***

## Arduino Setup:
* Plug Ethernet shield into Arduino Uno.
* Plug Seeed Relay Shield into Ethernet Shield.
* Attach 9 volt power supply to GND and +9V plugs of Relay Shield.
* PIR positive(+) to arduino 5V, PIR negative(-) to arduino GND, PIR OUT to HUB2 D3.
* Connect Ethernet shield to wireless router with Ethernet cable.

## Development:
~~I have recently added the rxtx-2.1-7r2 library written mostly in java to this repository. The rxtx-2.1-7r2 library is
the same one that is used in the Arduino IDE to allow the computer to communicate with the Arduino board through the
serial port. I hope to use this library to allow a developer to access and make modifications to the microcontroller's
code directly from the web interface on the robot's server.~~

Note: If editing this code in eclipse make sure to set up tomcat in the build path:
Right click on project ---> Properties ---> Java Build Path ---> Add Library... ---> Server Runtime ---> Apache Tomcat

Note: When deploying to Tomcat using the manager webapp you should first configure a username and password:
Edit etc/tomcat7/tomcat-users.xml as shown bellow. Change USERNAME and PASSWORD to what you want.

```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>  
<tomcat-users>  
  <role rolename="tomcat"/>  
  <role rolename="role1"/>  
  <role rolename="manager"/>  
  <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="tomcat"/>  
  <user username="both" password="tomcat" roles="tomcat,role1"/>  
  <user username="role1" password="tomcat" roles="role1"/>  
  <user username="USERNAME" password="PASSWORD" roles="manager,tomcat,role1"/>  
</tomcat-users>  
```

Note: If you make changes to a file you should restart Tomcat:
/etc/init.d/tomcat7 start
/etc/init.d/tomcat7 stop
/etc/init.d/tomcat7 restart

### Tools and libraries included in this project
* [Foundation UI](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* Tomcat7

The main idea that I am attempting to promote is onboard expirimental development. My goal is to create this software
so that I, and anyone else who needs it can develop and make changes to a robot's programming rapidly, and without
having to plug in via a tethered connection. My web interface also is designed to contain many usefull control, and
diagnostic tools.
