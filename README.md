### These the packages I installed to setup my server environment
sudo apt-get install ssh gnome-core gdm php5 libapache2-mod-php5

## Arduino Setup:
* Plug Ethernet shield into Arduino Uno.
* Plug Seeed Relay Shield into Ethernet Shield.
* Attach 9 volt power supply to GND and +9V plugs of Relay Shield.
* PIR positive(+) to arduino 5V, PIR negative(-) to arduino GND, PIR OUT to HUB2 D3.
