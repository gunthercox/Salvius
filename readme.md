Salvius
=========

This repository contains the source code for Salvius, a robot who uses a 
Rapsberry Pi and several Arduino microcontrollers as a brain.

> Salvius is a robot made out of recycled materials
> and designed to be able to perform a wide range of
> tasks by having a body structure that is similar to
> that of a human. The primary goal for Salvius is to 
> create a humanoid robot that will be able to function
> dynamically in a domestic environment.

**Key features:** 
  - Web based user interface
  - RESTfull API
  - Modular design makes it easy to add controllers via I2C

## Setup
Installing this software on your robot should be easy. Once you have downloaded 
the latest copy into a directory on your Rapsberry Pi, you can download and 
configure the robot's api and interface by running the following three lines of code.

```
apt-get install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
chmod a+x app.py
```

Use the following to run the robot's server.
```
python app.py runserver
```

## Features
I've included a package which allows the robot to tweet randomly selected 
messages to Twitter accounts. For now the robot cannot reply to users, however 
I have plans to add this feature. To use this feature you will need to register 
your app on https://dev.twitter.com/apps to get the token and secret keys. 
You will then need to create a file ```settings.py``` in the ```twitter``` 
directory with the following dictionary pointing to your Twitter keys and tokens.

```
# Set DEBUG flag to true for testing
DEBUG = True

# Twitter api
TWITTER = {
    'CONSUMER_KEY': '',
    'CONSUMER_SECRET': '',
    'TOKEN': '',
    'TOKEN_SECRET': ''
}
```
